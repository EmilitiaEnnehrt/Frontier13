<b>Rule 0:</b> Don’t be a dick
The most obvious detail many people miss when signing up for this server is that it’s a “Friend of Friends” unlisted server, meaning that everybody knows at least another person on here, and you are expected to treat strangers more like mutuals and not randoms. When playing, please practice common sense. If anyone is to be considered a net negative towards the server and drive away interests, we have the right to ban you.

<b>Rule 1:</b> Roleplaying Standards
Our server is a medium roleplay server, no matter what code we run on and how easy it is to abuse something; you are expected to at least have a believable character with believable interaction with others, the environment, and events around you. Actions that are considered insane, unrealistic, over-exaggerated, or harmful to the community will not be tolerated.

<b>Rule 2:</b> Maintaining a Respectful Environment
Everyone here is another’s mutual friend, please refrain from slurs, arguments, or personal grudge. Conflict will happen, and we are not a hug box, but leave the salts and sour taste with the round ending screen. Remember the good, forgive the bad, and understand. 

<b>Rule 3:</b> Play the Role you’ve chosen
We don’t have a lot of players for obvious reasons, if you have picked up roles that have responsibility; we expect you to at least attempt to do it. There’s not always a second doctor or engineer on the station to deal with something you’re tasked with.

<b>Rule 4:</b> Being Responsible as Antagonist or Security
Do know the boundaries, escalate the situation sensibly. Antagonists are not just a role of conflict, but to make the round more interesting, unique, or fun to others. If you are going too far; metagaming, being a dick, creating a difficult environment that’s unrelated to your task, or otherwise, you may be jobbanned.

<b>Rule 5:</b> Self Antagging and Validhunting
Our server has little security presence, and should not be made more difficult with non-antagonists creating troubles just for fun, or civilians interfering during security work or antagonist roleplays. If the situation warrants crew to fight against an antagonist overpowering security; be made deputies if preferable, or this should be sensible enough for us to understand.

<b>Rule 6:</b> Metacommunication
Also known as out of character interaction mid-play. If you need to speak to your friend, use in character talk, do not spew in-character information or communicate via LOOC, OOC, or the use of Voicechat.

<b>Rule 7:</b> Metagame
Basically “playing to win”, using all available mechanics and abuse them in order to gain invincible edges against other players; it is not fun for others.
  
<b>Rule 8:</b> Erotic Content
No, we have minors here.
